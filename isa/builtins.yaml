# This is a non-public extension of Panda instruction set architecture.
# Each group from the section below defines a single 'builtin.*' instruction
# without predefined semantics. Each 'builtin.*' instruction can be
# dispatched to maximum 256 handlers, each executing in the interpreter's
# context (like all public instruction handlers do). These extension handlers
# are called builtins. Dispatching 'builtin.*' instructions to actual handlers
# is achieved via first immediate operand of each 'builtin.*' instruction.
#
# Following restrictions apply to the 'groups' section:
#
# * The entire 'groups' section must have exactly the same format as isa.yaml.
# * Each group must define exactly one 'builtin.*' instruction.
# * Each 'builtin.*' instruction must have exactly one encoding format.
#   This limitation is introduced to avoid writing complex and untestable
#   code generation routines -- currently "one instruction <=> one format"
#   is enough. Feel free to remove this constraint on demand.
# * There must be no 'builtin.*' instructions with the same signature
#   (consult with the API for signature validation rules).
#
# Following restrtictions apply to the 'builtins' section:
#
# * All builtin names must be unique
# * Signature of each builtin must match exactly one signature of some
#   'builtin.*' instruction (consult with the API for signature matching rules).
#   Please note that there is no need to specify correspondence between
#   builtins and 'builtin.*' instructions explicitly, this done by the API.
#
# Following runtime restrictions apply to builtins handlers:
#
# * Builtin handler is not expected to run in parallel with GC at STW phase
# * Builtin handler must not trigger runtime operations that start GC
#
# NB! Important note about ordering and dispatch table layout.
# The order of builtin definitions in this file is not important. However,
# API may reorder these definitions to guarantee following layout
# for the dispatch table:
#
# public_opcode_01
# public_opcode_02
# ...
# builtin_opcode_01
# builtin_opcode_02
# ...
# builtin_01_for_builtin_opcode_01 \
# builtin_02_for_builtin_opcode_01 | All builtins with signature of builtin_opcode_01
# builtin_03_for_builtin_opcode_01 /
# builtin_01_for_builtin_opcode_02 \
# ...                              | All builtins with signature of builtin_opcode_02
# builtin_NN_for_builtin_opcode_02 /
