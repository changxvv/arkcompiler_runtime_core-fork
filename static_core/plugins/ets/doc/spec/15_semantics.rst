.. _Semantic Rules:

Semantic Rules
##############

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

This Chapter contains semantic rules to be used throughout the Specification
document.

Note that the description of the rules is more or less informal.

Some details are omitted to make the understanding easier. See the
formal language description for more information.

.. _Subtyping:

Subtyping
*********

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

The *subtype* relationships are the binary relationships of types.

The subtyping relation of *S* as a subtype of *T* is recorded as *S* <: *T*.
It means that any object of type *S* can be safely used in any context
in place of an object of type *T*.

By the definition of the *S* <: *T*, the type *T* belongs to the set of
*supertypes* of type *S*. The set of *supertypes* includes all *direct
supertypes* (see below), and all their respective *supertypes*.

.. index::
   subtyping
   binary relationship
   object
   type
   direct supertype
   supertype

More formally speaking, the set is obtained by reflexive and transitive
closure over the direct supertype relation.

The *direct supertypes* of a non-generic class, or of the interface type *C*
are **all** of the following:

-  The direct superclass of *C* (as mentioned in its extension clause, see
   :ref:`Class Extension Clause`) or type *Object* if *C* has no extension
   clause specified.

-  The direct superinterfaces of *C* (as mentioned in *C*â€™ implementation
   clause, see :ref:`Class Implementation Clause`).

-  The type *Object* if *C* is an interface type with no direct superinterfaces
   (see :ref:`Superinterfaces and Subinterfaces`).


.. index::
   direct supertype
   direct superclass
   reflexive closure
   transitive closure
   non-generic class
   extension clause
   implementation clause
   superinterface
   Object
   direct superinterface
   class extension
   subinterface

The *direct supertypes* of the generic type *C* <*F*:sub:`1`,..., *F*:sub:`n`>
(for a generic class or interface type declaration *C* <*F*:sub:`1`,..., *F*:sub:`n`>
with *n*>0) are **all** of the following:

-  The direct superclass of *C* <*F*:sub:`1`,..., *F*:sub:`n`>.

-  The direct superinterfaces of *C* <*F*:sub:`1`,..., *F*:sub:`n`>.

-  Type *Object* if *C* <*F*:sub:`1`,..., *F*:sub:`n`> is a generic
   interface type with no direct superinterfaces.


The direct supertype of a type parameter is the type specified as the
constraint of that type parameter.

.. _Least Upper Bound:

Least Upper Bound
*****************

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

The notion of the *least upper bound* (*LUB*) is used where a single type
must be found that is a common supertype for a set of reference types.

The word *least* means that the most specific supertype must be found, and
there is no other shared supertype that is a subtype of LUB.

A single type is LUB for itself.

In a set (*T*:sub:`1`,..., *T*:sub:`k`) that contains at least two types,
LUB is determined as follows:

-  The set of supertypes *ST*:sub:`i` is determined for each type in the set;

-  The intersection of the *ST*:sub:`i` sets is calculated.
   The intersection always contains the *Object* and thus cannot be empty.

-  The most specific type is selected from the intersection.


A compile-time error occurs if any types in the original set
(*T*:sub:`1`,..., *T*:sub:`k`) are not reference types.

.. _Override-Equivalent Signatures:

Override-Equivalent Signatures
******************************

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

Two functions, methods, or constructors *M* and *N* have the *same signature*
if their names, type parameters (if any, see :ref:`Generic Declarations`), and
their formal parameter types are the same---after the formal parameter
types of *N* are adapted to the type parameters of *M*.

Signatures *s*:sub:`1` and *s*:sub:`2` are *override-equivalent* only if
*s*:sub:`1` and *s*:sub:`2` are the same.

A compile-time error occurs if:

-  A package declares two or more functions with *override-equivalent*
   signatures.

-  A class declares two or more methods or constructors with
   *override-equivalent* signatures.

-  An interface declares two or more methods with *override-equivalent*
   signatures.

.. _Compatible Signature:

Compatible Signature
********************

.. meta:
    frontend_status: None

Signature *S*:sub:`1` with *n* parameters is compatible with the signature
*S*:sub:`2` with *m* parameters if:

-  *n <= m*; and
-  All *n* parameter types in *S*:sub:`1` are identical or contravariant to
   parameters types in the same positions in *S*:sub:`2`; and
-  All *S*:sub:`2` parameters in positions from *m - n* up to *m* are optional
   (see :ref:`Optional Parameters`).


A return type, if available, is present in both signatures, and the return
type of *S*:sub:`1` is compatible (see :ref:`Type Compatibility`) with the
return type of *S*:sub:`2`.

|

.. _Overload Signature Compatibility:

Overload Signature Compatibility
********************************

If several functions, methods, or constructors share the same body
(implementation) or the same method with no implementation in an interface,
then all first signatures without body must *fit* the last signature with or
without the actual implementation for the interface method. A compile-time
error occurs otherwise.

Signature *S*:sub:`1` with *n* parameters *fits* signature *S*:sub:`2`
if:

- *S*:sub:`1` has *n* parameters,
  *S*:sub:`2` has *m* parameters,
  and:
  
   -  *n <= m*; and
   -  All *n* parameter types in *S*:sub:`1` are compatible (see
      :ref:`Type Compatibility`) with parameter types that occupy the same
      positions in *S*:sub:`2`; and
   -  If *n < m*, then all *S*:sub:`2` parameters in positions from *n + 1*
      up to *m* are optional (see :ref:`Optional Parameters`).

- Both *S*:sub:`1` and *S*:sub:`2` have return types, and the return type of
  *S*:sub:`2` is compatible with the return type of *S*:sub:`1` (see
  :ref:`Type Compatibility`).

It is illustrated by the example below:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

   class Base { ... }
   class Derived1 extends Base { ... }
   class Derived2 extends Base { ... }
   class SomeClass { ... }

   interface Base1 { ... }
   interface Base2 { ... }
   class Derived3 implements Base1, Base2 { ... }

   function foo (p: Derived2): Base1 // signature #1
   function foo (p: Derived1): Base2 // signature #2
   function foo (p: Derived2): Base1 // signature #1
   function foo (p: Derived1): Base2 // signature #2
   // function foo (p: SomeClass): SomeClass 
      // Error as 'SomeClass' is not compatible with 'Base'
   // function foo (p: number) 
      // Error as 'number' is not compatible with 'Base' and implicit return type 'void' also incompatible with Base
   function foo (p1: Base, p2?: SomeClass): Derived3 // // signature #3: implementation signature
       { return p }

.. _Type Compatibility:

Type Compatibility
******************

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

Type *T*:sub:`1` is compatible with type *T*:sub:`2` if 

-  *T*:sub:`1` is the same as *T*:sub:`2`,

-  or, there is an *implicit conversion* (see :ref:`Implicit Conversions`)
   that allows to convert type type *T*:sub:`1` to type *T*:sub:`2`.

.. _Extended Conditional Expressions:

Extended Conditional Expressions
================================

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

|LANG| provides extended semantics for conditional-and and conditional-or
expressions for better alignment with |TS|. It affects the semantics of
conditional expressions (see :ref:`Conditional Expressions`), ``while`` and
``do`` statements (see :ref:`While Statements and Do Statements`), ``for``
statements (see :ref:`For Statements`), ``if`` statements (see
:ref:`if Statements`), and assignment (see :ref:`Simple Assignment Operator`).

The approach is based on the concept of *truthiness*, which extends the Boolean
logic to operands of non-Boolean types, while keeping the result of operation
(see :ref:`Conditional-And Expression`, :ref:`Conditional-Or Expression`,
:ref:`Logical Complement`) as boolean.
The value of any valid expression can be treated as true or false,
depending on the kind of the value type, as descibed in the table below:

.. index::
   extended conditional expression

   conditional-and expression
   conditional-or expression

+-----------------+-------------------+--------------------+----------------------+

The example below illustrates the way this approach works in practice. Any
*nonzero* number is treated as *true*, and the loop runs until it becomes
*zero*, as it is treated as *false*:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    for (let i = 10; i; i--) {
       console.log (i)
    }
    /* And the output will be 
         10
         9
         8
         7
         6
         5
         4
         3
         2
         1
     */
