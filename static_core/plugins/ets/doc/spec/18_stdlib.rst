Standard Library of the |LANG| language defines the required set of types,
classes, variables, constants and functions that provide APIs for effective and
convenient programming. 

Standard Library has two parts: the common one, which provides |TS| compatibility,
and the other one, which is |LANG|-specific while adding more advanced features.

Detailed description of all elements of the standard library is covered in
a separate document which is a part of the |LANG| distribution package.
