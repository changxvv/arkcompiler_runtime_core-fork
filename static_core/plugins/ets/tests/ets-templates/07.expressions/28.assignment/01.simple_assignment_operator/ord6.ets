  If the left-hand operand expression is a field access expression e.f (ยง7.11), possibly enclosed in one or more pairs of parentheses, then:
  - First, the expression e is evaluated. If evaluation of e completes abruptly, the assignment expression completes abruptly for the same reason.
  - Next, the right hand operand is evaluated. If evaluation of the right hand expression completes abruptly, the assignment expression completes abruptly for the same reason.
  - Finally, the variable denoted by e.f is assigned the value of the right hand operand as computed above.
